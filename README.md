# Adaptive-Cruise-Control-With-ThingSpeak-Cloud-Connectivity-using-MATLAB-Arduino

Description
Implement an adaptive cruise control system using the Arduino UNO board. The system is controlled by five
buttons of (1) Set_speed, (2) Adaptive_speed, (3) Cancel, (4) Increase_speed, and (5) Decrease_speed. After
power on, the display has to show the initial speed of 0.
1. When the Increase_speed button is pressed, the speed increases, and when the Decrease_speed
button is pressed the speed decreases however without pressing the Set_speed button the speed will
not remain constant and it changes slowly over time.
2. When the Set_speed button is pressed the system enters the cruise control mode where the speed is
held constant. In this mode, the Increase_speed button and the Decrease_speed button are still
functional and can be used to change the Set_speed. If the Cancel button is pressed, the system quits
the cruise control mode where the speed decreases slowly.
3. If the Adaptive_speed button is pressed, the speed is set and held constant until a vehicle shows up at
the front or an object is detected where the speed automatically decreases. When the road becomes
clear, the speed increases to reach the set speed again. In the adaptive cruise control mode, the display
has to blink to differentiate this mode from the cruise mode. In this mode, the Increase_speed button
and the Decrease_speed button do not function but the Cancel button can still be used to quit the
adaptive cruise mode. If the Cancel button is pressed, the display stops blinking and the vehicle speed
begins to slow down.
4. The implemented system has to be able to communicate with the ThingSpeak platform to store the
speed data on the cloud. ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (IoT) application that supports MATLAB
to analyze and visualize data
